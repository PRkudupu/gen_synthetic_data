Generate telemetry data for biking
1)We need to have openAI workbench 
2)Simple prompt to generate 10 records
 Please create smaple table with 10 recordds that are similar to this example
 [
  {
    "CustomerID": 100401,
    "StartTime": "022224 07:00:00",
    "EndTime": "022224 07:45:00",
    "AvgHR": 148,
    "MaxHR": 167,
    "AvgMPH": 14,
    "MaxMPH": 24,
    "AvgOxygen": 94,
    "ElevationGain": 760,
    "KCal": 465,
    "Weight": 180,
    "Age": 32
  }
]

3)Please generate a synthetic dataset of 1000 records that are similar to this example
[
  {
    "CustomerID": 100401,
    "StartTime": "022224 07:00:00",
    "EndTime": "022224 07:45:00",
    "AvgHR": 148,
    "MaxHR": 167,
    "AvgMPH": 14,
    "MaxMPH": 24,
    "AvgOxygen": 94,
    "ElevationGain": 760,
    "KCal": 465,
    "Weight": 180,
    "Age": 32
  }
]
StartTime should be between 05:00:00 and 23:00:00.
EndTime is usually between 10 and 90 minutes later with most sessions around 30 minutes.
AvgHR is usually between 135 and 172.
MaxHR is never more than 180 or less than 135.
AvgMPH is usually around 10 to 20 MPH.
MaxMPH is never more than 50 MPH.
AvgOxygen is usually between 94 and 99 with the occasional outlier closer to 90.
ElevationGain will be between 0 and 4000 feet.
KCal is highly dependent on the StartTime and EndTime as well as AvgMPH and ElevationGain as well as the weight. A 30 minute session for a 200LB person with 500 feet of elevation gain is usually around 380, higher durations, speeds, or elevation gains should relate to higher KCal numbers.
Ages will range from 16 to 76 with ages between 18 and 38 having the highest MPH and ElevationGain
 
4)Generate code for generating the sample dataset
Please write some python code that will generate a synthetic dataset of 1000 records that are similar to this example
[
  {
    "CustomerID": 100401,
    "StartTime": "022224 07:00:00",

    "AvgHR": 148,
    "MaxHR": 167,
    "AvgMPH": 14,
    "MaxMPH": 24,
    "AvgOxygen": 94,
    "ElevationGain": 760,
    "KCal": 465,
    "Weight": 180,
    "Age": 32
  }
]
StartTime should be between 05:00:00 and 23:00:00.

6) Prompt to generate customer dataset
Please generate some python code that will produce a table of 1000 records that are similar to the following example.  When selecting synthetic names, they should reflect a large variety of cultures, backgrounds, and ages.  First and last names should generally be from the same culture.

[
  {
    "CustomerID": 100001
    "FirstName": "Russ",
    "LastName": "Thomas",
    "Age": 32,
    "Weight": 185

### Explanation:
- **Faker Library**: This script uses the Faker library with multiple locales to ensure that names are generated from a broad array of cultures.
- **CustomerID**: A unique ID is assigned to each customer, starting from 100001.
- **Names**: First and last names are generated using different locales to simulate diversity.
- **Age**: Randomly assigns an age between 18 and 90 years, representative of a wide age range.
- **Weight**: Randomly assigns a weight in pounds from a typical range for adults.

### Instructions:
1. **Install Required Library**: Make sure to install the `Faker` library using pip: `pip install Faker`.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment.
3. **Verify Output**: The script prints the first 10 records for a quick inspection. Adjust the printed range or any part of the logic to suit your specific needs.
